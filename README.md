# Gallbladder-Segmentation

Built a UNet-based image segmentation model to help camera auto-navigation in laparoscopic surgeries, 
with a vision to facilitate surgery and reduce operation time.

- Addressed limited labled data with transfer learning and data augmentation, and reached near 90\% Dice index with only 512 training images. 

- Designed customized loss function with cross entropy and Jaccard index to better optimize the segmentation. 

- Deployed interactive web demo for image segmentation on AWS.
